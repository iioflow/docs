The monome arc embodies the same basic design principles as our [grid](../grid), with highly-detailed controls for adaptable and intuitive interaction. Instead of a multitude of binary points, the arc has four incredibly precise continuous controls with visual indication to match.

## specifications

- high resolution knobs, 1024 ticks per revolution.
- each knob is encircled by a sixty-four segment light ring.
- every LED is individually addressable with sixteen steps of variable brightness.

## resources

Usability and programmability:

- [norns](arc-norns) - sound computer made by monome
- [computer](arc-computer) - macOS, Windows, and Linux
- [modular](arc-modular) - Eurorack modules which support arc
