[Ansible](/docs/ansible) provides all generations of arcs with a link to the world of musical voltage. Thanks to the tireless generosity and vision of `@scanner_darkly`, it's also possible to write your own firmware for it, or any monome module, via [multipass](https://llllllll.co/t/multipass-a-framework-for-developing-firmwares-for-monome-eurorack-modules/26354).

Though Ansible has been discontinued it, along with our other sunsetted Eurorack modules, have been ported into the virtual modular synthesis playground VCV Rack through tireless community efforts led by [`@Dewb`](https://github.com/Dewb/). [The monome VCV Rack library](/docs/grid/computer/vcv-rack/) fully replicates the hardware projects in a free software environment, connecting directly to hardware arcs over USB. When paired with a multi-channel DC-coupled audio interface, these modules find new life within any system.
