# arc studies

The arc is *intended* to be reimagined. You give it purpose and meaning that's all your own: instrument, experiment, tool, toy... choose your own adventure! Let's start with some introductory knowledge: potential energy for radical creative freedom.

The following tutorials show how to use different languages and environments to achieve the same goal: cycling values set off by encoder movement, with optional friction.
